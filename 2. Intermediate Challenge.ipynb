    "In this \"Intermediate Challenge\", you are expected to answer all of the \"Easy Challenge\" questions as well as five new questions.  You should use `data/sharks.csv` in this challenge, which is not as clean as the data in `data/sharks_cleaned.csv`.  You'll have to do data cleaning before you can answer some of the \"Easy Challenge\" questions.\n",

    "Easy questions:\n",

    " 1. How many total pings are in the Ocearch shark data?\n",
    " 2. How many unique species of sharks are in the data set?\n",
    " 3. What is the name, weight, and species of the heaviest shark?\n",
    " 4. When and where was the very first ping?\n",
    " 5. Excluding results with 0 distance traveled: what's the minimum, average, and maximum travel distances?\n",

    "Intermediate questions:\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Which shark had the most pings?\n",
    " 2. Which shark has been pinging the longest, and how long has that been?\n",
    " 3. Which shark species has the most individual sharks tagged?\n",
    " 4. What is the average length and weight of each shark species?\n",
    " 5. Which shark has the biggest geographic box (largest distance from min lat/lon to max lat/lon, not dist_traveled)?"
